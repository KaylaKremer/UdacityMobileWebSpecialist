#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

#### To Udacity Grader: Please use my included server files, located in ./data/server. I have modified the JSON data format it serves with Sails.js to work with my repo specifically!

Udacity resources I referenced to complete Stage 2 include:
* [Project 2 MWS Webinar with Doug Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2CJYf_XA58) - I watched this webinar and used his recommendation of Browserify with Gulp for the service worker file. I also decided to refactor fetchRestaurants in dbhelper.js with the fetch API after he pointed out that the original code still used XHR.
* [Uncaught ReferenceError: fetchNeighborhoods is not defined bug](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/3941) - I encountered the same error when using Browserify and this solution solved it.
