## :fork_and_knife: Project Overview: Stage 3 :fork_and_knife:

### To Udacity Grader:
#### :point_right: Please use my included server files, located in ./server! I have modified the JSON data format in localDiskDb.db to work with my repo specifically! Also, please use my Gulp task "gulp build" for Lighthouse audits.

#### :point_right: I have changed Google maps to be static images when pages first load. You can change it back to a live map by clicking on it. Extra features have also been added, such as the ability to delete restaurant reviews and offline functionality for the favorite buttons.
